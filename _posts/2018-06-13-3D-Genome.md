title: Three Dimensional Conformation of the Genome (3D genome)
---

# Introduction
 Three dimensional conformation related technologies contain 3C, 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET, HiC, Hi-ChIP, Capture-HiC, et,al.

# 3C

# 4C

# 5C


# ChIA-PET

# HiC
HiC is derivated from 3C to analyze genome-wide chromatin interactions.

1. Crosslinking DNA with formaldehyde.
2. Cleaving cross-linked DNA with restriction endonuclease digest.
3. Biotin-labeled nucleotides are annealed to the fragment end overhangs.
3. The blunt ends of the DNA fragments are ligated to form a circular molecule marked with biotin.
4. Shearing circular DNA and pulling down fragments marked with biotin.
5. The library is then sequenced by paired end strategy and mapped to the genome allowing fragment identity and abundance to be detected.
6. A pair of reads from a single ligated fragment map to two distinct position on the genome, the abundance of the reads provides the measure of frequently those two loci in contact.

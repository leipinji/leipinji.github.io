Lymphedema is swelling that is caused by a collection of too much lymph fluid. It usually happens in your arms and legs, but it can happen in other parts of your body, as well. This swelling may cause pain and limit how well the affected area moves.

Lymph is a protein-rich fluid that moves throughout your body in lymph vessels. It scoops up things like bacteria, viruses, and waste, and carries them to your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes then filter the fluid to get the impurities out of your body.

Normal lymphatic function relies on a balance of fluid between the lymphatic vessels and blood stream. Lymphatic muscle cells are critical for this fluid transport in that they contract and squeeze lymphatic vessels to move the fluid toward blood circulation. When this process is interrupted due to genetic abnormalities or physical damage to lymphatic vessels, lymphedema can occur.

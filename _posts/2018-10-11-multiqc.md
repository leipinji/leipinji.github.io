# Introduction about `MultiQC` software

Multiqc will search a given directory for the log file output by specific NGS analysis tools, and finally output a html format report.

# 1. Hisat2 log can not be found

When I first try to used `Multiqc` to combine all `Hisat2` output logs, I found that `Multiqc` could not recognize those log files. Then I found that I install `Multiqc` from conda and the version is too old, then I need to update `Multiqc`.

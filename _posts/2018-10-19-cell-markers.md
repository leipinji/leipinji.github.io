### CD31

[CD31 marker introduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cd31)

* CD31 is a marker for endothelial cells.
* CD31 is also called PECAM-1.

### LYVE1

Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, selective expression in lymph vessels.


### KI67

A marker for cell proliferation. [Ki67](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2014.2914)

### FOXP3

FOXP3 is a marker for regulatory T cell.

### CD3

marker for T cell

### CD3 APC

* Fluorochrome : Allophycocyanin (APC)
* The CD3 antigen is expressed only on mature T lymphocytes and on a sub-population of thymocytes. In peripheral blood, approximately 67 to 76% of lymphocytes are CD3+; this percentage is lower in young children and varies according to age.

### Granzyme B

Granzyme B is abundantly stored in the granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells.

### Cytokeratin

marker for epithelial cell

### D2-40

* lymphatic endothelium, the presence of lymphatics in various condition
* 38 kDa membrane mucoprotein originally detected on surface of rat podocytes
* fetal testis
* reacts to O-linked sialoglycoprotein

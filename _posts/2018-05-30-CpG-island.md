# Definition of CpG islands


CpG islands (or CG islands) are regions with a high frequency of CpG sites. Though objective definitions for CpG islands are limited, the usual formal definition is a region with at least 200 bp, a GC percentage greater than 50%, and an observed-to-expected CpG ratio greater than 60. The "observed-to-expected CpG ratio" can be derived where the observed is 

1. CpG islands length > 200bp
2. CpG islands GC percentage > 50%
3. CpG(obs) / CpG(exp) > 60%
	- CpG(obs) : number of CpG dinucleotide
	- CpG(exp) : (number of C * number of G) / length of sequence

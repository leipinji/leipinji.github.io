This blog is maintained by `Pinji Lei`.

* I got my B.S and Ph.D from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn), China.
* Recently I moved to [Edwin Steele lab](https://steelelabs.mgh.harvard.edu) as a research fellow

* Research Interests:
	- Genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.
	- Single cell sequencing
	- Bioinformatics

I decided to combine multi-omics, molecular biology, animal model and clinical data to identify potential targets for cancer therapies.

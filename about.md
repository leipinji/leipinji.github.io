This blog is maintained by Pinji.

I got my B.S and Ph.D from Wuhan University, China.

My research interests focus on genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.

I decided to combine multi-omics and clinical data to identify potential targets for cancer therapies.
